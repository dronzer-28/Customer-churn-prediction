# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## Objective: Develop an accurate predictive model to identify customer churn in a banking dataset.

### Description:

- Utilized a dataset containing information on 10,000 bank customers, including demographics, credit scores, account balances, and transaction history.
- Preprocessed the dataset by encoding categorical variables and performing feature scaling using StandardScaler.
- Constructed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and output layer.
- Applied regularization techniques (L2 regularization) to mitigate overfitting and improve generalization.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio and conducted model training on the training set.
- Employed early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring the validation loss during training.
- Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy as the primary metric.
- Achieved an accuracy score of approximately 86% on the test set after regularization.
- Conducted further analysis to improve model performance, including learning curve analysis, precision-recall curve, and confusion matrix analysis.
- Explored additional techniques such as hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, and ensemble methods to enhance the model's accuracy further.
